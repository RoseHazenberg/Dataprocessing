Job 0: executing aligned/outB.sam into temp/outB.bam and samtools sort on the following temp/outB.bam to generate the following sorted/outB.sorted.bam with 2 threads

[Mon Mar 14 19:52:37 2022]
Error in rule samtools_sort:
    jobid: 0
    output: temp/outB.bam, sorted/outB.sorted.bam
    log: logs/samtools/B.log (check log file(s) for error message)
    shell:
        (samtools view -S -b aligned/outB.sam > temp/outB.bam | samtools sort temp/outB.bam -o sorted/outB.sorted.bam) 2> logs/samtools/B.log
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job samtools_sort since they might be corrupted:
temp/outB.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
